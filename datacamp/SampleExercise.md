The exercise has 3 - 4 sentences of “Context” that engage the learner and explain why they are completing the exercise.
● The exercise has 2 - 4 bulleted instructions. Each instruction is a complete sentence that describes a specific task (usually a single line of code that the learner must write).
● The solution code is no more than 15 lines of code (including 4 - 5 lines of code comments and any necessary line breaks).
● The sample exercise assesses one or two measurable learning objectives
