# Course Outline
## Instructions
Create an outline of one of the courses you would include in your proposed track.
A course outline has four chapters, each of which has a descriptive name.
● Chapter 1 has three lessons and Chapters 2 - 4 have 3 or 4 lessons each.
● Each lesson has at least one specific, measurable learning objective.

● Each learning objective begins with “Learner will be able to...” and uses a verb from the
following list (connected to levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy):

● The ordering of lessons is optimized for learner engagement and narrative coherence.
● The course outline is sufficiently detailed to prove that the course will satisfy the
learning objective stated in the proposed track.
● The course outline is not reflective of an existing course.
● The course can be completed in about 4 hours by a learner of appropriate skill level.
