# Track Proposal: Accounting Fundamentals in Python
Data analysis has emerged as accounting's most desired skill. Data-wise accountants are able to modernize business processes, automate repetitive tasks, and integrate accounting functions with data from other business operations more efficiently. The world has moved beyond spreadsheets: accountants can use machine learning algorithms to identify and predict cost drivers. Whether you are preparing for the CPA exam's newly introduced data management and analytics sections or simply want to harness the power of Python to complement your accounting knowledge, this track is for you.


## Track Learning Objectives:
  Be the end of this course, you'll be able to:
   - Apply the basic building blocks of Python and NumPy to organize and manipulate accounting data
   - Reframe traditional spreadsheet tasks for execution in Python with the popular Pandas library, matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebooks
   - Construct functions to source accounting data from Excel and CSV files as well as APIs using the OpenPyXL, csv, and requests modules.
   - Evaluate accounting processes and internal controls for automation opportunities -- then leverage os.path, PyPDF2, Python-Docx, and PyAutoGi libraries to write automation scripts in Python
   - Investigate revenue and expense drivers for use in budgeting decisions using scikit-learn, Python's accessible machine learning library

## Courses
### 1. Introduction to Python for Accounting
  Learn why Python is a great tool for accountants. This course introduces the essentials of Python and NumPy, one of Python's most popular libraries for dealing with numbers.

 ######  Learning Objectives:
  By the end of this course, students will be able to...
  - Understand the benefits of Python (and its many libraries) for use in an accounting environment
  - Apply fundamental programming concepts such as variable setting, debugging, control flow and data types to basic accounting problems.

### 2. Intermediate Python for Accounting
  Anything you can do in a spreadsheet can also be done more quickly in Python with the help of Pandas! Let's learn how.

 ######  Learning Objectives:
  By the end of this course, students will be able to...
  - Execute and present Python code with Jupyter Notebooks
  - Create, read, copy, and update data in Pandas DataFrames and Series objects
  - Clean, manipulate and summarize data in Pandas by merging, grouping, filtering, and generating pivot tables

### 3. Importing and Managing Accounting Data in Python
  By working with data in Python, you have access to the tremendous resources in Python's modules and libraries. In this course, we will use a few of those modules to source data from a variety of file types so that you can manipulate it with Python.

 ######  Learning Objectives:
  By the end of this course, students will be able to...
  - Read and write Excel and CSV files from Python scripts with the help of the OpenPyXl module
  - Explain basic API mechanics and draft API requests using the requests library
  - Examine newly imported data with matplotlib to identify errors and basic data cleaning needs

### 4. Introduction to Accounting Process Automation with Python
  Now that you're comfortable working with data in Python, let's explore its advantages over spreadsheets. In this course, we'll use Python to automate repetitive tasks to strengthen internal controls and free up time.

 ######  Learning Objectives:
  By the end of this course, students will be able to...
  - Assess accounting processes for automation opportunities
  - Use the os.path library to access, update, create, and delete filepaths
  - Automate form filling in PDF and Word using PyPDF2 and Python-Docx

### 5. Intermediate Accounting Process Automation with Python
  Use graphical user interface (GUI) automation to simulate human user interface interactions such as clicks, opening the ability to create even more complex automations.

 ######  Learning Objectives:
  By the end of this course, students will be able to...
  - Build automated bridges between software interfaces using GUI Automation through PyAutoGi
  - Construct regular expressions to match patterns in accounting data
  - Combine Python functions/scripts into organized, reusable code using a basic package

### 6. Budgeting and Forecasting in Python with Scikit-Learn
  It's time to harness the power of machine learning! In this course, we will use Python's most popular machine learning library to understand financial statements and predict business outcomes.

######   Learning Objectives:
  By the end of this course, students will be able to...
  - Evaluate accounting data for areas where machine learning can provide additional insight
  - Compare machine learning regression models using classic metrics such as MSE and MAE
  - Apply machine learning concepts to accounting problems such as identifying expense drivers and sales prediction
